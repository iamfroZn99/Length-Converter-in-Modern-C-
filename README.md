Length Coverter in C++

It is a simple and concise version of an example given in Ivor Horton's C++20: Beginner to Beyond book, the context has been made a bit more user friendly and also format library is used which helps in putting variables.

It takes your input in yards, feet and inches and converts it into inches and then takes inches and converts it into yards, feet and inches. 

Here is a sample of the output:
Enter the yard portion of your length: 2
Enter the feet portion of your length: 1
Enter the inch portion of your length: 6
The distance given by you in inches is 90

Enter your length in inches: 90
The converted length is 2 yards 1 feet 6 inches

All the enter statements take user input.

Make sure you have a C++20 compatible compiler like MSVC(Visual Studio 2019 or later) or g++(Version 10 or higher).
